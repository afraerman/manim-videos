Here is my story of installing manim community version.

Operation system: Ubuntu 22.4 LTS

I've installed manim locally as a python library.

Following the installation tutorial (https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/linux.html#required-dependencies)
I did:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev ffmpeg

which worked just fine.

I already had python and pip installed, so I skipped the line

$ sudo apt install python3-pip

Eventually I got to line

$ pip install manim

which got me an "unable ot locate package" error.

The solution to this (at least for me) can be configuring a virtual environment.

The best description I found is this one (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)
All I ahd to do was:

$ python3 -m venv <DIR>
$ source <DIR>/bin/activate

After doing this virtual environment is being activated which is shown in the beginning of the command line:

(<env_name>) $ 

Now simple

(<env_name>) $ pip3 install manim

worked like a charm.

Now to operate with manim in the interactive mode from command line you call

(<env_name) $ manim -p --renderer=opengl path/to/file.py <SceneName>

For more information I found useful this tutorial (https://www.aquabeam.me/manim/opengl_guide/)
as well as (https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html)
